Just run the wordcount_and_median.py file. The program will take all of the files in the wc_input 
directory and output both a running median and count of unique words in the wc_output directory.

Sample input and resulting output have already been provided. Feel free to add your own input files to your fork.

You do have the option of running this with other directories for input and output, though the program will not
create them if they do not already exist.
